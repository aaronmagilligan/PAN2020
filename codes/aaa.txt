Notes for the NE 201 lecture by Alex Brown on Monday April 4, 2016

This lecture will be an overview of the material from Chapter 14 of my lecture notes.

I will pass out a folder call "dens" - put this on your windows desktop.
We will use this in class to carry out calculations for the discussion.

aaa.for is a wrapper for my energy-density functional program dens.
We will use this to calculate properties of nuclei with results shown in the 
following *.pdf files:

a) pot - the central EDF potentials for the nucleus
b) sps - the single-particle energies for the nucleus
c) den - the densities for the nucleus
d) nm  - the nuclear equations of state (nucleus independent)

param.den gives the default set of Skyrme parameters to be used.

We will discuss the following questions based on these figures:

a) pot

1) What determines the radial size of the potentials? 
2) What causes the oscillations in the potentials?
3) What other parts of the potential are important?

b) sps

1) What are magic nuclei?
2) What are the spins and parities for nuclei near the magic nuclei?
3) What determines if a nucleus is stable to beta decay?
4) How do we construct excited states for nuclei?
5) What is the effect of the Coulomb interaction?
6) What determines the neutron drip line?
7) What determines the proton drip line?
8) Are any superheavy nuclei magic?

c) den 

1) What is nuclear saturation for the density?
2) What is the effect of the Coulomb energy?
3) What is the neutron skin?
4) What is a neutron halo? 
5) What is a bubble nucleus?

c) nm

1) What is the fixed point for the matter EOS?
2) What is the nuclear matter in-compressibility?
3) What is the fixed point for the neutron EOS?
4) What determines the properties of a neutron star?
